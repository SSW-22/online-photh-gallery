# Project Title

Online Photo Gallery (a.k.a. OPG)

## Description

Using OPG, anyone can express their works, ideas, and thoughts with just a few clicks to a worldwide audience. 

## How It Started

### Ideation

We started from an idea where we wanted to build a place where anyone can express their works of photography with litle to no cost and believed an internet would be the best place.


### Sprint Planning

This project took 4 sprints (2-week cycle) to compelete. Below screenshots show how we utilized Notion tool to create a scrum board and how each ticket is structured.

### Sprint Retro

Every end of each sprint, we gathered and spent time together to reflect back on how we did. This helped us to identify potential pitfalls at an early stage so that we could avoid having the same mistakes in the following sprints (and to celebrate what we did well!).
